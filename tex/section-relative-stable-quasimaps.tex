\section{Relative stable quasimaps}

\subsection{Review of absolute stable quasimaps}
The moduli space of stable (toric) quasimaps is an alternative compactification of the moduli space of smooth curves in a toric variety $X$. It admits a perfect obstruction theory and hence a virtual fundamental class, which one can use to define curve-counting invariants for $X$.

This theory agrees with the theory of stable quotients \cite{MOP} when both are defined, namely when $X$ is a projective spaces. They admit a common generalisation in the theory of stable quasimaps to GIT quotients \cite{CFKM}. In this paper, however, we restrict ourselves to the toric setting.

We now briefly recall the definition and some basic properties; see \cite{CF-K} for more details.
\begin{definition}[{\cite[Definition 3.1.1]{CF-K}}] Let $X= X_{\Sigma}$ be a smooth and projective toric variety with fan $\Sigma \subseteq N_{\QQ}$ and let $\OO_{X_\Sigma}(1)$ be a fixed polarisation, which we can write (non-uniquely) in terms of the $T$-invariant divisors as:
\begin{equation*} \OO_{X_\Sigma}(1) = \otimes_{\rho \in \Sigma(1)} \OO_{X_\Sigma}(D_\rho)^{\otimes \alpha_\rho} \end{equation*}
for some $\alpha_\rho \in \Z$. Given a fixed genus $g \geq 0$, number of marked points $n \geq 0$ and curve class $\beta \in \HH_2^+(X)$ a \ilemph{stable (toric) quasimap} is given by the data
\begin{equation*} ((C,x_1,\ldots,x_n), (L_\rho,u_\rho)_{\rho \in \Sigma(1)}, (\varphi_m)_{m \in M}) \end{equation*}
where:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(C,x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ is a prestable curve of genus $g$ with $n$ marked points;
\item the $L_\rho$ are line bundles on $C$ of degree $d_\rho = D_\rho \cdot \beta$;
\item the $u_\rho$ are global sections of $L_\rho$;
\item $\varphi_m \colon \otimes_\rho L_\rho^{\otimes \langle \rho, m \rangle} \to \OO_C$ are isomorphisms, such that $\varphi_{m} \otimes \varphi_{m^\prime} = \varphi_{m + m^\prime}$ for all $m, m^\prime \in M$.
\end{enumerate}
These are required to satisfy the following two conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \ilemph{nondegeneracy}: there is a finite (possibly empty) set of smooth and non-marked points $B \subseteq C$, called the \ilemph{basepoints} of the quasimap, such that for all $x \in C \setminus B$ there exists a maximal cone $\sigma \in \Sigma_{\operatorname{max}}$ with $u_\rho(x) \neq 0$ for all $\rho \not\subset \sigma$;
\item \ilemph{stability}: if we let $L = \otimes_\rho L_\rho^{\otimes \alpha_\rho}$ then the following $\QQ$-divisor is ample
\begin{equation*} \omega_C(x_1 + \ldots + x_n)\otimes L^{\otimes \epsilon} \end{equation*}
for every rational $\epsilon > 0$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\begin{remark} This definition is motivated by the $\Sigma$-collections of D. Cox \cite{CoxFunctor}; see also \S \ref{Functoriality of Quasimap Spaces Section}. The point is that a (stable) quasimap without any basepoints is the same thing as a (stable) morphism $C \to X$. The basepoints thus appear in the boundary of the moduli space, in much the same way as the locus of stable maps with rational tails appears in the boundary of the moduli space of stable maps. \end{remark}

More generally, we can define the notion of a family of quasimaps over a base scheme $S$, and what it means for two such families to be isomorphic; we thus obtain a moduli space
\begin{equation*} \Q{g}{n}{X}{\beta} \end{equation*}
of stable (toric) quasimaps to $X$, which is a proper Deligne--Mumford stack of finite type. It can be shown that this definition does not depend on the choice of polarisation.


As with the case of stable maps, there is an alternative characterisation of stability which is much easier to check in practice; a prestable quasimap is stable if and only if the following conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the line bundle $L$ defined above must have strictly positive degree on any rational component with fewer than three special points, and on any elliptic component with no special points;
\item $C$ cannot have any rational components with fewer than two special points.
\end{enumerate}
Condition (1) is analogous to the ordinary stability condition for stable maps. Condition (2) is new, however, and gives quasimaps a distinctly different flavour to stable maps; we shall sometimes refer to it as the \ilemph{strong stability condition}.

The moduli space $\Q{g}{n}{X}{\beta}$ admits a perfect obstruction theory relative to the moduli space $\MM_{g,n}$ of source curves, and hence one can construct a virtual class
\begin{equation*} \virt{\Q{g}{n}{X}{\beta}} \in \Achow_{\operatorname{vdim}\Q{g}{n}{X}{\beta}} \left( \Q{g}{n}{X}{\beta} \right) \end{equation*}
where the virtual dimension is the same as for stable maps:
\begin{equation*} \operatorname{vdim}\Q{g}{n}{X}{\beta} = (\dim{X} - 3)(1-g) - (K_X \cdot \beta) + n \end{equation*}
Since the markings are not basepoints there are evaluation maps
\begin{equation*} \ev_i : \Q{g}{n}{X}{\beta} \to X \end{equation*}
and there are $\psi$-classes defined in the usual way by pulling back the relative dualising sheaf of the universal curve:
\begin{equation*} \psi_i = \operatorname{c}_1(\sigma_i^* \omega_{\mathcal{C}/\om{Q}}) \end{equation*}
Putting all these pieces together, we can define \ilemph{quasimap invariants}:
\begin{equation*} \langle \gamma_1 \psi^{a_1} , \ldots, \gamma_n \psi^{a_n} \rangle_{g,n,\beta}^X = \int_{\virt{\Q{g}{n}{X}{\beta}}} \prod_{i=1}^n \ev_i^* \gamma_i \psi_i^{a_i} \end{equation*}
(We use the same correlator notation as in Gromov--Witten theory; since we will never talk about Gromov--Witten invariants this should not cause any confusion.)
